    <h2>Text-to-Speech Result Samples</h2>
    <p>
      These examples are sampled from the evaluation set for Table 1 in the paper.
      Each column corresponds to a single text, and each row corresponds to different methods.
      Our proposed final method at last row, <b>P10</b>, showed the best result from evalutation including MOS and ABX test in terms of the speech quality and style similarity.

    <h3>Texts:</h3>
     <strong>Text 1</strong>: It was true, too.<br> 
     <strong>Text 2</strong>: "Oh, I know I ought!" she cried.<br> 
     <strong>Text 3</strong>: The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother.<br>
     <strong>Text 4</strong>: She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy.<br> 
     <strong>Text 5</strong>: "No door!" cried Mary.<br>
     <strong>Text 6</strong>: No one but herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and look at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it.<br>
